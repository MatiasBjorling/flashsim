/* Channel class
 * Brendan Tauras 2010-08-09
 *
 * Single bus channel
 * Simulate multiple devices on 1 bus channel with variable bus transmission
 * durations for data and control delays with the Channel class.  Provide the 
 * delay times to send a control signal or 1 page of data across the bus
 * channel, the bus table size for the maximum number channel transmissions that
 * can be queued, and the maximum number of devices that can connect to the bus.
 * To elaborate, the table size is the size of the channel scheduling table that
 * holds start and finish times of events that have not yet completed in order
 * to determine where the next event can be scheduled for bus utilization.
